# ðŸ“± PWA Features

To-Do Soft is installable as a Progressive Web App:

- `manifest.json` defines app name, icons, screenshots, categories, and start behavior
- `<meta name="theme-color">` adapts to light/dark mode
- App runs fullscreen (`display: standalone`)
- Touch icons and maskable icons support mobile integration

It can be added to the home screen on Android/iOS for a native-like experience.
