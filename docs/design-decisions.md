# 💖 Design Decisions

## Pastel UI
Chosen to create a calming, friendly aesthetic to reduce cognitive friction.

## Mascot Encouragement 🐇
A soft bunny mascot helps build emotional engagement. Messaging updates with progress to create feedback loops.

## Dark Mode
Toggles via `data-theme`, using CSS custom properties. Accessible via button and screen-reader friendly.

## Confetti
Subtle Web Animations (`✨`) triggered on completion. Falls back gracefully for `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Streak Tracking
Motivates continued use through visual streak logic. Updates based on active completed tasks.

## Empty State
Gentle prompt instead of a harsh “no data” message. Encourages user without shame.
